# Automated Car Parking System
The Mobile Smart Prebook Automated Car Parking System project aims to revolutionise traditional parking management by leveraging advanced technologies to enhance user experience and optimise parking operations. Built with Flutter and Firebase.

The project seeks to automate the allocation of parking spaces based on user bookings, reducing congestion and optimising parking space utilisation. Integration of technologies such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and optical character recognition (OCR) will facilitate seamless identification and allocation of parking spaces.
